        <p>
        Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones (winter does not occur in most of the tropical zone).
        It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the sun
        . Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, winter is distiguished by it's shorter hours of daylight and it's colder temperature.
        </p>
        <P>
          During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle. In regions experiencing winter, the same amount of solar radiation is spread out over a larger area.
          This effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere,
          allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible

        <p>
           When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer
           temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere.Winter runs in the northren hemisphere from December 1 to February 28
         </p>
        <h1>
            Southern Hemisphere
        </h1>
        <p>
          Winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun.
          Winter in the southren hemisphere starts from June 1 and ends August 31.
