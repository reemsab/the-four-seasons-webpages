            Definition
        </h1>
        <p>
         Spring is one of the four conventional temperate seasons, following winter and preceding summer
         . There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according
         to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere,
         it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring,days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with day length increasing and night
         length decreasing as the season progresses.Also trees and bushes that lost their leaves over the winter begin to grow new leaves again and also flower in spring.
         This happens because the temperature of the air and soil starts to warm up and the hours of daylight.
